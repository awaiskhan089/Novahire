## Local Setup

1. Clone and install dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/awais0892/NovaHire.git
cd NovaHire
composer install
npm install
```

2. Configure environment.

php artisan migrate --seed
```

4. Start development services.

```bash
composer run dev
```

## Security Checklist

- Never commit `.env` or real credentials
- Rotate API keys if they are ever exposed
- Use least-privilege keys for OpenAI, Stripe, and Google APIs
- Restrict webhook endpoints and validate webhook signatures
- Enable HTTPS in all non-local environments
- Review role and policy changes before deployment

## Git Hygiene

- `.gitignore` is configured to exclude secrets, local caches, build artifacts, and temp probe files
- Keep only placeholders in `.env.example`
- Run a secret scan before pushing:

```bash
rg -n "(OPENAI_API_KEY|STRIPE_SECRET|GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET|BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY|ghp_)" -g "!.git" -g "!node_modules" -g "!vendor"
```

## Deployment Notes

Before production deploy:

- Set all required environment variables
- Run `php artisan config:cache` and `php artisan route:cache`
- Run migrations in a maintenance-safe window
- Ensure queue workers and cron are configured
